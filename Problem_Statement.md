# Approach and Architecture

This project is a Multi-Agent AI Study Assistant built using Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Gemini API.

The system uses a root agent called study_agent which coordinates three sub-agents: explanation_agent, question_agent, and roadmap_agent.

Each sub-agent performs a specific task. The explanation_agent explains the topic, the question_agent generates interview questions, and the roadmap_agent provides a learning roadmap.

This modular architecture makes the system scalable, organized, and efficient.

Google ADK handles agent orchestration, and Gemini provides intelligent responses.
